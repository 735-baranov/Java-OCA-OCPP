# Java-OCA-OCPP
Client and server library of Open Charge-Point Protocol from openchargealliance.org

With this library, you can easily get started with the Open Charge-Point Protocol.
The design is driven by test, which will ensure premium software that is easy to adapt and modify to your needs.

Once done, we will support every version of OCPP on any preferred connection SOAP or Web Socket.
However, the first release will aim to implement OCPP version 1.6 on Web Socket with json as format.

Incoming request events are split into feature profiles as described in the OCPP specification.
I recommend that you download and read the specification from openchargealliance.org
